we are going to be building a bot that interacts with a premade cli bot for launching solana memecoins.

the bot we will be using is called InfinityAIO. read every single page of their gitbook: https://infinity-scripts.gitbook.io/infinity-aio

i have an ubunutu 20 server that we need to move the .zip file to that contains the bot.

we are going to ssh into the server and build the rest of the bot from there.

IP:	65.108.40.174
Username:	root
Password:	$7zAg8faKIHLOGUJFb5EteR21wmr

we will also store all environment variables in a .env file.

we need to dockerize the bot.

we need to install dependencies.

we can start the bot with the following command: npm run start

something that we need to apply to all interactions with the bot is that it needs to wait for the bot to finish before we enter the next command. there should be a 1 second delay between entering the command and the bot finishing.

once the bot starts with the npm run start command, we need to reply with the number 2.

there will be additional commands that we will build later.
